# Hi, I’m Jesper Anteryd

## From Teaching to Tech
Before transitioning into AI development, I worked as a high school teacher specializing in history of religion and psychology, but i have taught in a variety of subjects. My primary interest that got me into teaching was actually a series of travels to Nepal and India when i was in my 20's. Ultimately though teaching was not what i wanted to do for the rest of my life, so i moved on to tech which i have to say I am
very happy about doing.


## My Journey with Development and AI so far...
I started learning Python on my own in 2023/2024, then applied and tested for an AI/Python Dev program at Teknikhögskolan in Gothenburg, Sweden. 
In short, what we have covered:
- First semester: basic python and data analysis, with the standard libraries like numpy, pandas, etc.
- Second semester: machine learning with sk-learn, then onto DL and the more advanced libraries of Keras and Pytorch.
   
Writing this at the end of May '25, I’ve just completed my first year! First week into summer, I got restless and decided to read up on Git—now I’ve done my 
first remote commit on some of my school projects that I think are decent enough.


## Private ML/DL Student Projects (available on request)
Due to examination policies, several of my machine learning and deep learning projects remain private. I'm happy to share access upon request — here's a quick overview:

- **ML Pipeline Automation in Scikit-Learn**: A modular application to semi-automate training and evaluation of classical ML models. Handles EDA, model selection (classification/regression), plotting, and final deployment.

- **Custom ANN Framework in Keras**: A multi-layer Perceptron system with subclassed architectures for classification and regression. Includes automatic preprocessing, training logic, and evaluation plots — demonstrated in Jupyter notebooks for both binary and multiclass problems.

- **Modular RNN Time Series Engine in Keras**: Designed to train separate LSTM models per input feature for efficient time-series forecasting. Enables scalable experimentation and recursive predictions without requiring high-end hardware.

Just shoot me a message if you'd like to explore any of them!

## Looking for Internship
I’m currently looking for an internship for my next two semesters:
- Fall '25: 9 weeks
- Spring '26: Pretty much the whole semester


## Plan for summer '25
- ~~Effective Python skills, like learning Git, etc~~
- ~~Basics with Flask / SQLAlchemy~~
- ~~Basic overview of frontend HTML, CSS and JS)~~
- An app for exploring fractals (Flask or Tkinter?)
- Pytorch! most DL i have done is in Keras, but i think pytorch is the way to go...

- Read / study :
   - ~~The Pragmatic Programmer~~
   - Python OOP (by Lott & Phillips)

That's it! thanks for visiting :)
