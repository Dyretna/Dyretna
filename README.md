# 👋 Hi, I’m Jesper Anteryd

## 🌱 My Journey
I started learning Python on my own in 2023/2024, then applied and tested for an AI/Python Dev program at Teknikhögskolan in Gothenburg, Sweden. 
Writing this at the end of May '25, I’ve just completed my first year! First week into summer, I got restless and decided to read up on Git—now I’ve done my 
first remote commit on some of my school projects that I think are decent enough (but be nice, though!).

## 💼 From Teaching to Tech
Before transitioning into AI development, I worked as a high school teacher specializing in history of religion and psychology, but i have teached in a
variety of subjects. My primary interest that got me into teaching was actually a series of travels to Nepal and India when i was in my 20's, studying
buddhist philosphy. Ultimately though teaching was not what i wanted to do for the rest of my life, so i moved on to Tech which i have to say I am
very happy about doing.

## 🎯 Looking for Internship
I’m currently looking for an internship for my next two semesters:
- Fall '25: 9 weeks
- Spring '26: Pretty much the whole semester

If my small student-projects looks promising and you have space for an intern, let me know! (Bear in mind I’m new, but check out the learning curve 😉).

## 🛠️ Plan for summer '25
- Effective Python skills, like learning Git, etc
- More OOP
- Redo some old project with Flask 
- Pytorch! most DL i have done is in Keras, but i think pytorch is the way to go...
- Perhaps look into design patterns

That's it! thanks for visiting :)
