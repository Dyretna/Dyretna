# Hi, I’m Jesper Anteryd

## From Teaching to Tech
Before transitioning into AI development, I worked as a high school teacher specializing in history of religion and psychology, but i have taught in a variety of subjects. My primary interest that got me into teaching was actually a series of travels to Nepal and India when i was in my 20's. Ultimately though teaching was not what i wanted to do for the rest of my life, so i moved on to tech which i have to say I am
very happy about doing.


## My Journey with Development and AI so far...
I started learning Python on my own in 2023/2024, then applied and tested for an AI/Python Dev program at Teknikhögskolan in Gothenburg, Sweden. 
In short, what we have covered:
- First semester: basic python and data analysis, with the standard libraries like numpy, pandas, etc.
- Second semester: machine learning with sk-learn, then onto DL and the more advanced libraries of Keras and Pytorch.
   
Writing this at the end of May '25, I’ve just completed my first year! First week into summer, I got restless and decided to read up on Git—now I’ve done my 
first remote commit on some of my school projects that I think are decent enough.

That's it! thanks for visiting :)
