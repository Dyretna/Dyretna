# 👋 Hi, I’m Jesper Anteryd

## 💼 From Teaching to Tech
Before transitioning into AI development, I worked as a high school teacher specializing in history of religion and psychology, but i have teached in a
variety of subjects. My primary interest that got me into teaching was actually a series of travels to Nepal and India when i was in my 20's. Ultimately though teaching was not what i wanted to do for the rest of my life, so i moved on to tech which i have to say I am
very happy about doing.


## 🌱 My Journey with Development and AI so far...
I started learning Python on my own in 2023/2024, then applied and tested for an AI/Python Dev program at Teknikhögskolan in Gothenburg, Sweden. 
In short, what we have covered:
- First semester: basic python and data analysis, with the standard libraries like numpy, pandas, etc.
- Second semester: machine learning with sk-learn, then onto DL and the more advanced libraries of Keras and Pytorch.
   
Writing this at the end of May '25, I’ve just completed my first year! First week into summer, I got restless and decided to read up on Git—now I’ve done my 
first remote commit on some of my school projects that I think are decent enough.


## 🎯 Looking for Internship
I’m currently looking for an internship for my next two semesters:
- Fall '25: 9 weeks
- Spring '26: Pretty much the whole semester

Unfortunately, i cannot publish my examination-projects but just let me know and i will open it for you!


## 🛠️ Plan for summer '25
- ~~Effective Python skills, like learning Git, etc~~
- ~~Basics with Flask / SQLAlchemy~~
- ~~Basic overview of frontend HTML, CSS and JS)~~
- An app for exploring fractals (Flask or Tkinter?)
- Pytorch! most DL i have done is in Keras, but i think pytorch is the way to go...

- Read / study :
   - ~~The Pragmatic Programmer~~
   - Python OOP (by Lott & Phillips)

That's it! thanks for visiting :)
